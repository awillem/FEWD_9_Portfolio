**Project 9 - Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree**    
***Capstone Portfolio***

For this final project of the Front End Web Development Techdegree, I was given a blank slate to create our own portfolio, with a few requirments.  The design is to be mobile first site that works on phones and desktop, include at images that link to at least 4 projects, along with a description of the project. I also needed to include contact information, at least one example of javascript interactivity, and then host the site someplace like GitHub Pages.




***Exceeds Expectations***
* Include a breakpoint for tablet displays
* Link to more than 4 projects
* Use SVG images for contact info icons
* Multiple JavaScript interactions
  * I used JS to add a sticky navbar
  * I also used JS to add interactivity to my Projects section.  This code does multiple things like setting how many project cards (1, 2, or 3) display based on the width of the screen, adding classes to the project cards as the navigation arrows are clicked, and when either the first or last card is reached, adding a disabled class to the arrow so it can't be clicked.
